DEADLINE - al treilea seminar (intarziere = 2p)  
  
dash.infinityfree.com => free daca nu vrem MySQL local  
  
BD snapshot type: you see only the current state  
BD transaction time type: we want to be able to see the istoric and do rollback  
	-we trigger an update/delete and the istoric is not altered  
  
Valid time: represents the valid data (from the date ... until date ... smth will have a new value, but we can change our mind even if the date didn't reach and change the data- or delete it)  
e.g a credit card expired on date x and the client can say he don't need anymore and i can delete it or the client wants to shorten the expire date and we change it  
  
Bitemporal entity: i can modify the parts that belong to the valid time but the istoric of this actions is kept
